<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Advanced Glycation End Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-fluorescent AGEs</li><li>Fluorescent AGEs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) are categorized into two primary market types: non-fluorescent AGEs and fluorescent AGEs. Non-fluorescent AGEs, typically formed during prolonged sugar and protein interactions, play a critical role in diabetes and aging-related diseases but lack specific fluorescence properties. Conversely, fluorescent AGEs exhibit unique fluorescence characteristics, making them easier to detect and study in biological systems. Both types are significant in research and therapeutic applications, impacting health, nutrition, and disease management strategies.</p></p>
