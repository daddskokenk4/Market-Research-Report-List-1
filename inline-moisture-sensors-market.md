<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inline Moisture Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inline moisture sensors are essential for monitoring moisture levels in various industries. The market can be categorized into two main types: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type sensors measure moisture directly by coming into contact with the material, offering high accuracy for solid or liquid samples. Non-contact type sensors, on the other hand, use electromagnetic waves or infrared technology to detect moisture without direct contact, ideal for sensitive materials or situations requiring minimal disruption. Both types serve critical functions in quality control and process optimization.</p></p>
